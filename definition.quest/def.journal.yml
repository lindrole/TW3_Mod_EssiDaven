      description:
        - dandelion_found: I was waiting for Geralt not far from White Orchard, to show a him a special place to me.<br/>
        - after_grave: Geralt learned of Essi's sad fate and later discovered that this devil Gaunter O'Dimm had provoked it.<br/>A mixture of anger and injustice filled Geralt, who went to Yennefer for help.<br/>
        #- after_meet_mirror: After this unexpected encounter, it became clear that Poppet's illness was not due to bad luck, but had been caused by that devil of Gaunter O'Dimm.<br/>Geralt's memories of his time with Essi becoming more and more precise, he couldn't bring himself to let this demon continue his misdeeds.<br/>So Geralt decided to seek help from Yennefer, and her knowledge of necromancy.<br/>
        - choice_pearl_yen: Although noticeably jealous at Geralt's mention of Poppet, Yennefer agreed to help him.<br/>She asked him to find a sky blue pearl like the one Geralt had given to Little-Eye.<br/>To do this she advised him to find Agloval, Duke of Bremerwoord, and her companion Sh'eenaz, the celadon-haired mermaid, who agreed for love to change her fishtail into legs.<br/>
        - sheenaz_agloval_found: Sh'eenaz pointed Geralt to a place where he could find one of these pearls.<br/>
        - back_to_yen: Returning to Yennefer after finding the pearl, Geralt was surprised to see Ciri there.<br/>Ciri told him that as a child in the Temple of Melitele, she had read Essi's collection of poems, and that it had filled her with emotion.<br/>Meanwhile Yennefer had found a way to enchant the pearl to help them defeat this devilish being.<br/>
        - final_ciri: The pearl enchanted by Yennefer had the desired effect, and allowed Geralt and Ciri to defeat Gaunter O'Dimm, and thus avenge Poppet.<br/>
