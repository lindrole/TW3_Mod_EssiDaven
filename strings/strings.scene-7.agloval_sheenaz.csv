2115984700|00000000||I followed the Path.
2115984701|00000000||It's a too long story.
2115984702|00000000||Sh'eenaz.
2115984703|00000000||Duke.
2115984704|00000000||Geralt!
2115984705|00000000||How have you been since all these years?
2115984706|00000000||Let's say I followed the path.
2115984707|00000000||What is your visit worth to us?
2115984708|00000000||I'm here for Essi Daven.
2115984709|00000000||Poor child…
2115984710|00000000||I learned what had happened to her.
2115984711|00000000||Yes, she didn't deserve that.
2115984712|00000000||She was a gifted girl, who knew how to say the right words.
2115984713|00000000||And this, as well in her ballads, as in the moments let's say… opportune.
2115984714|00000000||I have experienced it.
2115984715|00000000||What happened to her was not really a coincidence.
2115984716|00000000||An ancient, powerful and evil being provoked it.
2115984717|00000000||It's awful!
2115984718|00000000||I didn't know how to give back to Essi the feelings she had for me,
2115984719|00000000||but I would at least try to avenge her.
2115984720|00000000||For that I need a sky blue pearl identical to the one I gave to Little-Eye.
2115984721|00000000||It won't be easy.
2115984722|00000000||They are rare.
2115984723|00000000||However, I think that with witcher senses,
2115984724|00000000||it should be possible to find some on the coast north of here.
2115984725|00000000||But I think that the local sirens won't be as welcoming as my mermaid sisters from Bremervoord.
2115984726|00000000||I'll settle for that.
2115984727|00000000||Thanks for your help.
2115984728|00000000||Thank you for your visit Geralt.
2115984729|00000000||I have no doubt that you will succeed.
2115984730|00000000||See you soon.
2115984731|00000000||That would be too long a story to tell.
