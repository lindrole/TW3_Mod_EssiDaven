2115984600|00000000||I met her in Bremerwoord.
2115984601|00000000||Dandelion and Essi, were longtime friends.
2115984602|00000000||What a surprise!
2115984603|00000000||You are just in time.
2115984604|00000000||I was gathering my things for my departure from Skellige.
2115984605|00000000||Before you leave,
2115984606|00000000||I'd like to ask for your help.
2115984607|00000000||And what kind of help?
2115984608|00000000||Help me to slay a demon.
2115984609|00000000||A demon?
2115984610|00000000||You are getting ambitious.
2115984611|00000000||I love this.
2115984612|00000000||But where does this crazy idea comes from?
2115984613|00000000||This demon killed a dear friend of Dandelion and me,
2115984614|00000000||named Essi Daven.
2115984615|00000000||I heard about her.
2115984616|00000000||But I didn't know you had been friends.
2115984617|00000000||I met her while helping Duke Agloval of Bremerwoord.
2115984618|00000000||I had given Essi a sky blue pearl…
2115984619|00000000||Spare me the details of your encounter with that bard, please.
2115984620|00000000||Although I am a powerful sorceress, defeating a demon is beyond my skills.
2115984621|00000000||I preferred to develop my knowledge on other subjects than the extermination of demons.
2115984622|00000000||If you see what I mean…
2115984623|00000000||I can't guarantee I'll find a way to kill a demon.
2115984624|00000000||However, I should be able to tell you how to keep it from harming anybody for a few centuries.
2115984625|00000000||But for that I will need a little time to study the question.
2115984626|00000000||I will probably also have to go and get ancient books.
2115984627|00000000||How can I help you?
2115984628|00000000||I don't know much about demons,
2115984629|00000000||but necromancy is no stranger to me.
2115984630|00000000||Although I don't know exactly how to go about it yet,
2115984631|00000000||I think that we will need an object that would bind the deceased and you.
2115984632|00000000||That pearl that you gave her might be interesting…
2115984633|00000000||I have heard that the Duke of Bremerwood and her companion Sh'eenaz,
2115984634|00000000||are currently staying in Novigrad on the Temple Isle.
2115984635|00000000||It seems to me that this could be a good starting point to find out how to get your hands on one of these pearls.
2115984636|00000000||In the meantime,
2115984637|00000000||I will find out how to prevent this demon from harming.
2115984638|00000000||I'll be back in few days.
2115984639|00000000||Thanks, Yen.
2115984640|00000000||Dandelion and Essi, were longtime friends.
2115984641|00000000||I can't imagine Dandelion just being friends with a girl.
2115984642|00000000||Yes, it's surprising, but Dandelion had a real brotherly love for her.
