2115984300|00000000||Yes, I remember.
2115984301|00000000||Sorry, but I don't remember.
2115984302|00000000||Here we are. It's here.
2115984303|00000000||Here what?
2115984304|00000000||Here where rests Essi.
2115984305|00000000||Do you remember Little-Eye?
2115984306|00000000||Yes, I remember. The memory of her came back to me quite quickly after my amnesia.
2115984307|00000000||I considered Poppet as my little sister.
2115984308|00000000||She was running after life, while death was on her heels.
2115984309|00000000||She was in Vizima at the time of the smallpox epidemic. And it took her away.
2115984310|00000000||I couldn't be able to bring myself to watch her body burning on the funeral pyres.
2115984311|00000000||So I buried her in this peaceful place, far from the city.
2115984312|00000000||This is very sad news that you are telling me.
2115984313|00000000||I was not able to return to her the feelings she had for me. But it is certain that she affected me.
2115984314|00000000||She did not deserve this tragic fate.
2115984315|00000000||Sorry, but I don't remember. I guess it's due to my amnesia.
2115984316|00000000||You met some years ago with Essi, when you and I went to Bremervoord.
2115984317|00000000||She had genuine feelings for you, even though things were different on your end.
2115984318|00000000||The three of us went a little way together, then we separated.
2115984319|00000000||She kept, worn as a lucky talisman, the sky blue pearl that you gave her.
2115984320|00000000||I considered Poppet as my little sister.
2115984321|00000000||She was running after life, while death was on her heels.
2115984322|00000000||She was in Vizima at the time of the smallpox epidemic. And it took her away.
2115984323|00000000||I couldn't be able to bring myself to watch her body burning on the funeral pyres.
2115984324|00000000||So I buried her in this peaceful place, far from the city.
2115984325|00000000||This is very sad news that you are telling me.
2115984326|00000000||I regret telling that her sky blue pearl would bring her luck.
2115984327|00000000||No, Geralt.
2115984328|00000000||She knew your words were a little sacrifice to make her feel better.
2115984329|00000000||And yet it was your sky blue pearl that gave her the courage to face her greatest fear. Because a part of you accompanied her.
2115984330|00000000||Like her lute, she kept it with her until the end. And still carries it on her heart.
2115984331|00000000||Sometimes Essi comes back to life in my dreams, as if nothing had happened.
2115984332|00000000||Thank you, Geralt, for coming with me.
2115984333|00000000||I didn't have the courage to come alone, and I knew you would pass by. That's why I was waiting for you not far from here.
2115984334|00000000||In these moments, together we are stronger, even if we are no less sad.
2115984335|00000000||It is alone that we mourn, because we are alone when we feel.
2115984336|00000000||I'm going back to Novigrad.
2115984337|00000000||Do you come with me?
2115984338|00000000||Having feelings is not my main strength. Nevertheless, I feel the need to collect myself here longer.
2115984339|00000000||I understand.
2115984340|00000000||If where she is, Poppet sees us. She is most certainly happy to know you are here.
2115984341|00000000||See you soon, Geralt.
