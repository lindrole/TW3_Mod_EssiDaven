Tuning the results - some options
---------------------------------

Before you try you probably should take a look at the steps for generating the
animations, first. Just to see at which point you tweak stuff. It's out of scope
to describe the individual parts and how they work in more detail - search the web
or wikipedia for more info on phonemes, IPA, pocketsphinx and eSpeak for starters.

Here it's more about the "big" picture.

The whole workflow is organized like this:

Now you know.



1. Tuning of (3) phoneme files (timings and weights)
----------------------------------------------------

This is the most "easy" and also most promising tuning option. It's also the
option you'll most probably be forced to do if you want somewhat usable results.

Phonemes of result (1) are not very accurate but they do have valueable timing
information. Phonemes of result (2) are a very accurate translation (sometimes
even too accurate) but lack any timings. The matching of (1) and (2) is not
trivial and most of the time the result (3) is full of gaps and/or mismatchings.

You can see the waveform of the used audio in the phoneme extractor gui and spot
the silent parts and various changes in the curve on a timeline. Directly below
is a bar with differently stretched blocks displayed. Every block represents one
phoneme and is positioned and sized according to the extracted information from
(1). Its label is the match from (2). The bar is aligned and in sync with the
audio waveform display so the phoneme and timing information can be directly
compared (they don't have to match exactly just more or less!).

In addition to timings it's also possible to adjust weights of specific phonemes
(increase for more emphasize or decrease to compensate overemphasised phonemes).

Please remember: the lipsync animation is 30fps. Meaning ~30ms delta for a phoneme
timing moves the generated weight by only one frame. Lower deltas affect the
smoothed curve, though. Just don't think timing adjustments of <15ms will have
much impact on the animation.


Remove gaps
-----------
Lowest hanging fruit: try to resolve all gaps (as in unmatched phonemes) in a
sane way, for example by extending predecessor and successor phoneme durations.
Phoneme durations *may* overlap (the generator does not generate such timings but
it's sometimes usefull) but there should not be an >= 10ms gap between subsequent
phonemes as it's considered as a begginning of a "silence".

There is an automatic option to remove all gaps that can be triggered by pressing
the "gap close" button. It will remove all the "unknown" unmatched phonemes and
close the gaps by extending the neighboring phoneme blocks. However this does not
work correctly in every case - so be sure to check the results!


Setup forced word gaps
-----------------------
Even if timings <15ms do not have much visible effect on "normal" lipsync
animations *gaps* of > 10ms will be treated slightly different and "force"
something like a "break-up" of an otherwise too long animation, e.g. open mouth
spanning two words. You'll have to experiment.


Verify phonemes positions
-------------------------
Sometimes the matching produces a gap at the wrong position and a phoneme sequence
is moved before or after the "real" gap. Adjust the timings by comparing with the
audio waveform.


Setup aliases
-------------
Some phoneme mappings are not available in the repo.lipsync mappings. It may be
necessary to change a "translated" IPA phoneme to a "similar" phoneme to get data
or even break up some diphones (multilette phonemes).

In this case the extraction has to be redone. Delete the generated *.phoneme file(s)
and start the phoneme extractor gui again. It will automatically try to extract
phonemes for all audio files that do not have a matching phoneme file.


Adjust weights
--------------
The IPA translation of eSpeak produces some emphasis on specific phonemes
according to some encoded pronounciation rules. These may not necessary match the
spoken audio -> change the weight slider to emphasize or compensate.



2. Tuning of curve generation (pose weights and smoothing)
----------------------------------------------------------
These settings are located in the repo.lipsync/lipsync_settings.yml file and
affect *ALL* generation (4) + (6).

It may help to tune the weights for some posetracks to emphasize or compensate
some over emphasized generation. It may also create a unique animation trait for
a specific character.

The smoothing kernels can also be adjusted - but you should probably not touch
that.



3. Tuning of phoneme curve snippet mapping
------------------------------------------
This is basically the hardcore stuff in (5). Changes also affect ALL generation.

These mappings were extracted from the game files lipsync animations automatically:
Based on the timings the phoneme extractor deduced from a (big) set of the game
audio files and a heuristic scoring function which hopefully picked the better
curve snippet sets (or not...). The src of the snippet is recorded as comment.
They are by far not optimal but seem to work adequately most of the time (at least
for the examples I tested).

However there are certain phoneme mappings/contexts which seem to be off. Those
can be tuned by hand. A couple were already adjusted by hand (see the comments).
It's difficult but feel free to adjust weights, remove some or define additional
posetracks snippets for a specific context.

The standard downloaded package contains a stripped down version of (exactly the
same) repo.lipsync files which contain a couple of more "alternatives" to the
curve snippets. Some of them could be a better choice - or not. If you want to
tune the mappings you should take a look at the extended repo package, first.



4. Tuning of specific weights for a specific frame of a specific posetrack of a specific audio
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah.. you can do that, too. Directly in the generated (7) lipsyncanim.csv. But
you won't.
