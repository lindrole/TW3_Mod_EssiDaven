HOWTO convert audio into wem format
------------------------------------

For the conversion you need Wwise from https://www.audiokinetic.com/

This *minimal* howto is only intended for the conversion into wem. The software
suite can do MUCH MUCH more.

Download and installation of required software
-----------------------------------------------

All tests were done with version v2015.1.6 which is no longer available from the
audiokinetic WEbsite. The older version v2013.2.9 was used by CDPR to create W3
and (obviously) works, too. Be aware that there are reported issues with other
versions. Version v2013.2.9 is available on nexus.

1. Download (offline version) from https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3234
   For x64 offline installation you need:

    - Wwise_v2013.2.9_Setup.exe
    - Authoring_Data.msi
    - Authoring_x64.msi

    - in addition you may need one or all of the MS runtimes:
        - vc2008redist_x64.exe
        - vc2010redist_x64.exe
        - vc2013redist_x64.exe

2. Install the above


Conversion of wav to wem
-------------------------

Note: the order is important! Settings in step 3 must be set before audio is
imported!

1. Start Wwise

2. Create new project

3. Set default conversion
    - Project/Project Settings/Source Settings/
        - Default Conversion Settings:
            Vorbis Quality High

4. Import audio:
    - Project/Import Audio Files...
        - (optional) Import as: Sound Voice
        - add files
            - files must be uncompressed wav (use 44.1khz or 48khz mono for voice)
        - Import

5. (optional) clear audio cache (removes all previously created files from cache dir):
    Project/Clear Audio File Cache...

6. Convert all audio files:
    - Project/Convert All Audio Files...

7. Copy all wem files from cache to a save location
    - cache location:
        in your project dir ".cache/..."
